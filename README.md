# Burglar Alarm using AND GATE


In this project, we will simulate a Burglar Alarm on Tinkercad using the 7408 IC, which is a quad 2-input AND gate. The objective is to emulate the functionality of a burglar alarm system by employing the 7408 IC to combine signals from two separate inputs: a simulated door/window sensor and a motion sensor. When both sensors are triggered simultaneously, the AND gate will produce an output signal, activating a simulated alarm or buzzer. This project serves as a basic demonstration of how an AND gate can be utilized to create a simple yet effective burglar alarm system.
